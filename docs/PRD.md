# Product Requirements: Multi-lingual Todo Application

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based todo application with integrated translation capabilities. The application enables users to manage tasks and translate them into multiple languages, targeting individuals and teams working in multilingual environments.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1. Problem Statement

Users working in international contexts often need to communicate tasks in multiple languages. Existing todo applications require manual translation or switching between apps, disrupting workflow and reducing productivity.

### 2.2. Solution

A unified todo application that seamlessly integrates task management with automatic translation, allowing users to create and manage tasks efficiently, instantly translate them into over a dozen languages, and maintain productivity across language barriers.

### 2.3. Target Audience

The primary users for this application include international teams, remote workers, language learners, travelers, and multilingual families.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Core Features

The application will provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for todo items. The translation system will support over 12 languages, with a one-click translation button on each todo item. To preserve the original context, the source text will always be displayed alongside the translation. Data persistence will be handled via `localStorage`, automatically saving todos, the translation cache, and the user's selected language preference. A client-side rate limit of 30 translations per day will be enforced, with a visual counter to inform the user of their remaining quota.

### 3.2. User Interface

The user interface will be clean and intuitive. The layout will feature a header with the application title, a prominent language selector, a clear input form for adding new todos, a scrollable list of todo items, and a footer with status information and bulk actions. Interactions will be designed to be efficient, with keyboard support for adding todos, clear loading states during translation, and responsive feedback for all user actions.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1. Frontend Architecture

The application will be built with SvelteKit and TypeScript for a performant and type-safe codebase. Styling will be implemented with Tailwind CSS. State management will be handled by Svelte stores, with `localStorage` for persistence.

### 4.2. API Integration

The MyMemory API will be used for all translation services. Communication will occur over a RESTful interface via HTTPS. The integration will include client-side rate throttling and graceful error handling that defaults to the original text if a translation fails.

### 4.3. Testing

The testing strategy will ensure a high level of quality and reliability. Unit tests will cover all business logic, with a target of 90% coverage. Component tests will validate user interactions, and end-to-end tests will cover critical user journeys.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Performance

The application must be highly performant. The initial load time should be under 3 seconds on a 3G connection, and all local user interactions should respond in under 100 milliseconds. Translations, including the API call, should complete in under 2 seconds.

### 5.2. Accessibility

The application will be fully accessible. This includes complete keyboard navigation, screen reader support via proper ARIA labels, WCAG AA color contrast compliance, and clear focus indicators.

### 5.3. Security

Security will be a primary consideration. All user input will be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks. The application will not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII). All API communication will be over HTTPS.

## 6. Constraints and Future Enhancements

### 6.1. Constraints

The project will be developed within a 48-hour timeframe by a single developer, using only free-tier services. This imposes a technical constraint of the MyMemory API's global limit of 5,000 words per day and the browser's `localStorage` limit of approximately 5-10MB.

### 6.2. Future Enhancements

Future development phases may include user accounts for cloud synchronization, collaborative features for shared lists, and additional organizational tools like categories and due dates.
